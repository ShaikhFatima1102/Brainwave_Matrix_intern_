#Password Strength Assessment Tool

This Python tool assesses the strength of passwords based on various factors like length, complexity, and uniqueness. It provides a score and feedback to help users improve weak passwords.

## Features

- *Length Check*: Ensures the password meets the recommended length.
- *Character Variety*: Checks for the presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- *Common Patterns*: Detects common sequences, repeated characters, and dictionary words.
- *Feedback*: Provides detailed suggestions on how to strengthen the password.

## How It Works

The tool analyzes the password by evaluating the following factors:

1. *Length*:
    - Strong passwords should be at least 12 characters long.
    - Moderate passwords are between 8 and 12 characters.
    - Passwords shorter than 8 characters are flagged as weak.

2. *Character Variety*:
  - Checks if the password contains lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.

3. *Common Patterns*:
    - Flags passwords that contain:
      - Repeated characters (e.g., "aaa").
      - Sequential characters (e.g., "1234", "abcd").
      - Common dictionary words (e.g., "password", "qwerty").

4. *Scoring*:
    - Passwords are scored on a scale of 0 to 6 based on the length and variety of characters.
    - The feedback section provides specific suggestions for weak passwords.
### Improving Your Password

The tool will provide feedback to help improve weak passwords. Some tips include:
- Use at least 12 characters.
- Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- Avoid using common words, repeated characters, or predictable sequences.
